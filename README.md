My school uses an older version of mysql, this version doesn't allow the sharing of tables between computers.
Thus to make our projects and day to day usage easier I made a program complete with a gui to facilitate the conversion and saving of file to the local disk

What's missing-
●A way to save to any folder in the computer
(For now it saves to the desktop automatically)
●A way to exit the program from the program
●A way to select a table from the GUI

-Uses flet, and mysql.connector libraries
